# Solar System Simulation

A dynamic, interactive 3D solar system simulation built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project showcases the planets orbiting around the sun, complete with textures, orbit paths, and rotation.

## Features
- **Realistic textures** for the Sun and planets.
- **Orbiting planets** at proportional speeds and distances.
- A **skybox** for a space-themed background.
- Zoom, pan, and rotate controls using `OrbitControls`.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js** for rendering 3D graphics.
- **JavaScript** for controlling animations and interactions.
- **TextureLoader** for realistic planetary textures.
- **WebGLRenderer** for optimized rendering.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karttikjangid/solar-system-simulation.git
